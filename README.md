# email2kanban

A Python program that takes the contents of an email and converts them to a Kanban card on notion.so.

I often used this program for my tutoring business, and it definitely sped up my workflow. When clients would submit a scheduling request form, I would receive the email, but I would need to wait to contact the tutor and parent again to make sure the time and place they requested would work.

Most times, I would have several of these "back-and-forth" scheduling workflows going on simultaneously, and I needed a way to keep up with them so I wouldn't forget where each client was in the scheduling process.

What this program allowed me to do was create a Kanban card on Notion for each new scheduling request that came in so that I could quickly look at my Kanban board and know where each session was in the scheduling process, whether I was waiting on tutor or the parent or if I needed to contact one or the other.

I could see this program being customized to help in many different situations: from students managing incoming assignments to salespeople managing leads.

Of course, this program could be improved by automatically 1) checking the email server for incoming emails and 2) pasting the email into the file to process with Regex. Feel free to figure that out yourself. One day, I might get around to doing that.
